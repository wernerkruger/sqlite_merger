# sqlite_merger

This project was an Upwork piece of work. I created a generalized solution to solve this problem

The brief was as follows:

I am looking for a skilled developer who can create a script to merge two sqlite databases of the same structure.  The primary purpose of the merged database is to migrate data from two separate databases into one. The script should be able to merge the data from both entries into a single entry, ensuring that no duplicate entries are created.

Overall, the goal is to have a seamless and efficient merging of the two databases, ensuring that all data is accurately transferred.
